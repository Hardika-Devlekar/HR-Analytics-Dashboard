# HR-Analytics-Dashboard
I recently developed an HR Analytics Dashboard using Tableau to help HR teams gain actionable insights into employee performance, retention, and engagement. This interactive dashboard simplifies complex HR data, enabling data-driven decisions that boost organizational success.

Key Features:
- Real-time employee performance tracking 📈
- Turnover analysis and predictive insights 🔍
- Engagement and satisfaction metrics ❤️
- Visualized trends for informed decision-making 📊

By leveraging Tableau’s powerful visualization capabilities, I was able to create a dynamic and user-friendly tool that provides HR professionals with key metrics at their fingertips.
